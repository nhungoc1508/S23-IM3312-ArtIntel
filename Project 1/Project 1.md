## ‚ú® Introduction
For this project, I design an artifact for a possible future in which each person can connect with their alternate selves from other universes. The product, Nexus, is designed to be an interface facilitating the process of establishing such connections that allows users to temporarily acquire knowledge and skills from their alternate selves. Essentially, this project presents a collection of user interfaces designed to illustrate some of the speculative functions of such a product.

## üìù Ideation
My first idea was to design a centralized traffic control system that can plot routes and direct traffic of an entire city in order to minimize congestion and traffic accidents. I believe such a system is completely feasible for the near future, since autonomous vehicles have been a rising star of the AI world, and the question of optimization can be listed among the classic computer science topics. So I shelved the idea and diverted my attention a little further. On the Futures Cone, I wanted to climb from the probable area to the plausible or possible ones.

One of the four views, or four approaches, of AI is thinking humanly, that is, building computer models that can emulate the cognitive process of humans: trying to determine how human thinks inside their brains using introspection, psychological experiments, brain imaging, etc. The complexities of the human brain and our inability to map our own cognition have largely made this less of a goal for researchers and engineers. This inspired the final idea I settled on: a future in which artificial intelligence can truly understand human intelligence and can act as a facilitator to our cognitive processes.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Building the premises
Nexus is designed in the context of a science fiction-like world where the existence of the multiverse is tested and confirmed and not just a theory, and cross-universe communication is also possible. This is the premise for this project, but since it is not the main focus, I am skipping over the world-building. Much of this premise was inspired by the various pieces of media exploring the concept of multiverse over the past few years, like Marvel movies and shows, as well as my favorite 2022 movie *Everything Everywhere All At Once*. The concept of the ability to ‚Äòborrow‚Äô a skill or piece of knowledge from other people (or other versions of yourself) is inspired by the Netflix series *Sense8*. Below is a simple moodboard put together using the inspirations from the aforementioned pieces of media to keep the ideation process going.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Finalizing ideas

I was able to flesh out the idea as well as make some modifications and choices to keep the project workload manageable since I worked alone. As mentioned above, the core ideas of the project progress as follows:

- Speculative future: A future where artificial intelligence can truly understand human intelligence and can act as a facilitator to our cognitive processes.
- Speculative product function: AI can intervene in humans‚Äô process of knowledge acquisition and humans can learn new skills and knowledge by having their brains directly altered.
- Speculative product design: What will the interface look like?

At first, I planned to create mockups of an end-to-end brain-computer interface (either as images or some physical prototypes), but the calculated workload was not manageable given the time and resources I have. As such, I decided to tackle a part of the design process with a smaller scope: designing the user interface of the product. So the finalized results of the project include a collection of screens showcasing a number of user stories created for the product. Due to the futuristic, speculative nature of the design, I do not have in mind a fixed medium for the interface, though personally I would like for it to be an interactive hologram that is visible and usable to each individual.

## üíª User stories

The following are the 3 main user stories for the interface, corresponding to the 5 screens that will be shown in details in the next part:

- User can search for alternate selves according to their own needs for specific skills and knowledge
- User can view a detailed profile of a selected self with a list of most notable/suitable skills
- User can select a specific skill or area of knowledge from a selected self and view detailed information about that skill

## ‚úèÔ∏è Wireframing
I intended to develop some wireframes for the screens to serve as a sandbox for developing different ideas and designs. In the end, time did not permit, so I only have two wireframes illustrating the most basic ideas I had in mind for the layouts.

## üîç Product overview

### User profile

The Profile interface provides an overview into the user, which includes information about 1) their own vitality and state of being as well as 2) connections made to other selves.

This screen essentially serves as a centralized dashboard reporting data coming from all implanted devices, showing real-time data on the user‚Äôs brain activity, heart rate, and other similar vitality measurements. This is one of my main speculations for the future: implantable technologies will become part and parcel of being human.

The second part of this screen reports overview on the user‚Äôs cross-universe connections, showing the latest or most frequently established connection and the relevant ‚Äòborrowed‚Äô skills, among others.

</p>

### Browse

This screen lists all existing alternate selves of the user. The user can scroll through this gallery and navigate into each version to view more details.

### Search

This screen adds a second way that the user can search for alternate versions with skills suitable to their needs. The search bar allows the user to search with keywords, while the product is also constantly evaluating the user‚Äôs vitality measures, needs, and circumstances, to give suggestions on what the AI thinks is most beneficial to the user at a certain moment.

### Profile view

This screen gives a detailed profile on a selected alternate self, including a list of notable skills and knowledge possessed by this self that the model recommend to the user, based off of the user‚Äôs configuration and past activities using the product.

### Skill view

This screen gives more detailed information on a specific skill or knowledge of a selected self. Through establishing a connection with that universe, the AI is capable of autonomously gather information and build itself a model of that world, through which it can have meaningful cognitive understanding of the world like a human would and process that knowledge in a way that produces helpful information for the user. There are three main panels on this screen:

- Level of expertise: The interface gives a short description of how skillful an alternate self is at a certain skill. This requires the AI to truly understand the alternate universe and to successfully translate that back to the context of the original universe.
- Effects of vitality: The AI is also capable of accurately projecting how the act of ‚Äòborrowing‚Äô the skill will affect the user physically, based on the differences between the versions inferred from its knowledge base.
- Compatibility: After assessing the differences between the versions of the user, the AI gives an overview, or a warning, on how the differences will potentially lead to an incompatibility in skill utilization, in which case the user is warned not to make a connection.

Below are examples of Profile view followed by Skill view for the same self.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project speculates on the future of AI and human capabilities and studies a number of questions regarding the pervasiveness and invasiveness of AI in the human life. There are 3 main questions I‚Äôd like to put forth for further contemplation on this topic:

1. Where are the boundaries of technology? Will it get infused with our biology? Will it become part and parcel of being human?
2. If AI is capable of replicating and augmenting the human brain, do we just the models to intervene in cognitive processes?
3. How much trust do you put on AI? How much of your decision is truly yours?

Even though I do not have the definite answers to these questions myself, I believe the way each individual speculates on these questions will put this project in different areas on the Futures Cone. Is it a plausible, possible, or preposterous future?

## üß∞ Tools

Most of the illustrations used in this project were created using Midjourney. A number of photographs came from Unsplash. All the remaining components: graphics, designs, layouts, etc. were done using Figma.
